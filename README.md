# Password Interface with MATLAB
  
This is a simple example of how to make a password GUI with MATLAB, using [App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) and the [uihtml](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/uihtml.html) function.  
It shows how easy it is to embbed an HTML component into MATLAB.

## :books: Getting started ##
You can open the file **RUNME.mlx** to understand the files in the repo.  
The application uses also classic constraints for a password: number of characters, at least one upper case and one number.  

## :link: Prerequisites
No prerequisites or additional toolboxes is needed.

## :hammer: Installation
There is no particular installation.  

## :notebook: Usage
Run the ***app_password.mlapp*** with command line:  
```Matlab
app = app_password()
```
or directly by opening the file.
